Mid Term Advanced Programming Exam
=====================
My C# implementation of the mid term for Advanced Programming Exam.

# Exercise 1: A Regular expression parser and interpreter
I've wrapped the ambiguous grammar of the exercise in an equivalent LL1 grammar.
Parsing/interpreting steps are the follow:

1.  create a formatted version of the regex (expliciting the interval, and other).
2.  *first optimization:* I've converted the infix regex produced by the pre-parser into an equivalent one which is in post-fix mode. The Post Fix Mode is convenient to create a one-pass parser using an auxiliary Stack ([see this for more details](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~pjj/cs2121/fix.html));
3.  building of the Non-Deterministic Automata as described at page 153 of the Dragon Book using the algorithm proposed by the book.
4.  wrapped the NFAutomata to the equivalent DFAutomata using the algorithm proposed in the book.
5.  *second optimization:* optimized the DFA using [Minimizing Algorithm](http://www.cs.engr.uky.edu/~lewis/essays/compilers/min-fa.html)

The exercise has been developed using my implementation of DFA, NFA, EpsilonClosure,
Partitions, and other.
I suggest you to see the graphical scheme of all the classes used for parsing and interpreting language for Regular Expression proposed in the exercise: you can find a 'blue print' in Exercise1and2/ClassDiagram1.cd using Visual Studio IDE.

## Notes
According to the exercise ambiguity my version of IsMatch() corresponds to the System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.IsMatch() version of C# that retruns true if the strings matchs completely the Regular Expression.

# Exercise 2: Compile a Regular Expression and performance tests.
I've created a Compile() method in RegularExpression Class that can be called before IsMatch() call.
In this case (compiled version of the regex) the IsMatch() method invoke the IsMatch() method of the compiled class that is loaded and compiled usinc C# JIT.
I've generate a class file manually wrapping the MinimizedDFAutomata into a series of switchs-cases.
Then I used CSharpCodeProvider/Assembly classes of .NET to transform the produced source code into an executable class that implements ICompilable interface.

## Performances
Performances are pretty good: Tests mode executes the IsMatch() for the regular expression "(\[1-9\]\[0-9\]\*|0)(,\[0-9\]\*\[1-9\])?", that match all the float/int numbers, on a 100K digits number (imagine the first 100000 piGreco digits).
The test in my machine (OS: Windows 7, Processor: Inter(R) Core(TM) I7 (2,00GHz), RAM: 4GB), for the compiled version, returns 0.2398ms averege time of the 100 executions (approx. 240 microsecs to matchs 100000 digits).

# Exercise 3
I've adopted the "Programming By Contract" approach. I've implemented the IMap Interface and i've write a BST Implementation of the map in the BSTMap Class.
Programming by contract approach use REQUIRES and EFFECTS "words" in the method comments to inform users of the initial conditions and the excepted behavior after a methods calls.
Unfortunatelly C# standard tags has not these "words" in the tag system so:

* Requires are explained in the <summary> tags
* Effects are explained in the <return> tags
* Throwed exception are explained in the <exception> tags

Please see ClassBluePrint.cd for the complete class scheme.

# Exercise 4
Just a simply SCALA language tutorial. Read it :)
